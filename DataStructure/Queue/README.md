# Queue Data Structure

A Queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle. This means that the first element added to the queue will be the first one to be removed. This is similar to a real-life queue, such as a line of people waiting to get on a bus.

## Features

- **Enqueue**: Add an element to the end of the queue.
- **Dequeue**: Remove an element from the front of the queue.
- **Peek**: View the element at the front of the queue without removing it.
- **IsEmpty**: Check if the queue is empty.
- **Size**: Get the number of elements in the queue.
